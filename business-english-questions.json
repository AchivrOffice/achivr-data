      "title": "Business Vocabulary",
      "problem": "Your responses indicate difficulty with business collocations—the specific word combinations that native speakers use naturally. For example, we 'reach' a decision (not 'make'), 'address' concerns (not 'speak'), and 'meet' a deadline (not 'catch').",
      "tip": "When learning new business vocabulary, always note the words that typically appear together. Keep a collocation journal organised by verb: what do we 'raise'? (concerns, questions, issues). What do we 'meet'? (deadlines, targets, expectations)."
    },
    "register": {
      "title": "Professional Register",
      "problem": "Your responses suggest inconsistency in matching language formality to business contexts. Effective professionals adjust their communication style based on the audience, channel, and purpose—more formal for external clients and senior leadership, more conversational for immediate colleagues.",
      "tip": "Before writing any business communication, identify your audience and purpose. For new contacts and formal situations, favour complete sentences and conventional openings. Reserve contractions and casual expressions for established relationships with peers."
    },
    "diplomatic": {
      "title": "Diplomatic Language",
      "problem": "Your responses indicate a tendency toward direct expression where more nuanced language would be more effective. In professional contexts, softening devices and hedging language help maintain relationships while still communicating clearly.",
      "tip": "Build a repertoire of softening expressions: 'It appears that...', 'You may wish to consider...', 'There seems to be...'. These allow you to raise concerns without creating defensiveness."
    },
    "pragmatic": {
      "title": "Business Communication",
      "problem": "Your responses suggest difficulty recognising the underlying intent behind workplace communications or selecting contextually appropriate responses. Effective business communication requires reading between the lines and responding to what is implied as well as what is stated.",
      "tip": "When reading business communications, ask yourself: What does this person actually need? What response would move the situation forward? The most helpful reply often addresses the underlying concern rather than just the surface question."
